**Ferry Management System**

A ferry management system provides efficiency by streamlining driver and passenger assignment, enabling real-time ferry tracking, and facilitating smoother communication with parents and drivers for a state school setting. 
Built with a PHP backend and an HTML/CSS/JS frontend, the system offers robust security through advanced authentication and utilizes SMS functionality for timely updates. 
Designed collaboratively with team members, I took the lead on backend development and data model planning.
